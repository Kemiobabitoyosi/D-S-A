Algorithms are operations on different data structures + sets of instructions executing them

Needs to have defined problem, statement, input and output
The steps in algorithm need to be in a veru specific order
The steps also need to be distinct
The algorithm should produce a result
The algorithm should complete in a definite finite amount of time

Based on time and space complexity
Logaritm is the inverse of exponent which is how binary search works and works in sub linear time

Linear operation/search vs Binary operation or search 

Sublinear or logritmic runtime O(log n)
Constant runtime O(1) 
Quadratic O(n raise to power 2) runtime
Cubic runtimeO(raise to power 3)
Quasilinear O(n log n) runtime
Polymonial runtime (considered efficient)

Merge sort is quite simi;ar with binary search. It also carries out comparison operations unlike binary
